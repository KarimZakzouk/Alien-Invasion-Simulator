# Alien Invasion Simulator

A C++ project that simulates battles between Earth's defenses and alien armies, using data structures to analyze power dynamics and generate strategic battle statistics. This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement simulation logic and perform data-driven analysis using low-level programming techniques.

## My Role
This project was originally developed as part of a team effort during my studies at Cairo University. In this repository, I have recreated my individual contributions to showcase my work:

- Designed the simulation logic using data structures (e.g., linked lists, arrays) to model battle dynamics between Earth’s defenses and alien forces.
- Implemented statistical analysis to generate strategic insights, such as power dynamics and battle outcomes.

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: C++
- **Concepts**: Data Structures (linked lists, arrays, etc.), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Prerequisites
To build and run this project, you’ll need:
- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++` via GCC on Linux, MinGW on Windows, or WSL).
- Git to clone the repository.

## How to Run
Follow these steps to set up and run the Alien Invasion Simulator:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KarimZakzouk/Alien-Invasion-Simulator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Alien-Invasion-Simulator
   ```

3. **Compile the Code**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

4. **Run the Program**:
   ```bash
   ./AlienInvasion
   ```
5. **Starting the Program**:
   Upon execution, the program will prompt you to enter the name of the input file located within the `Inputs` directory. Please provide the filename in the `.txt` format. For example, if your input file is named `battle_data.txt`, simply enter `battle_data` when prompted, and the program will automatically append the `.txt` extension.

   Please review the project document for more information.




## Additional Notes
- **Team Context**: This project was originally a collaborative effort with my teammates, who hosted the initial version. This repository contains my personal implementation of my contributions.
